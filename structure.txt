Now you have a true standalone mode for both the code editor and whiteboard that doesn't depend on any backend calls. Here's how it works:
Standalone Mode:
Simply navigate to /session/new or /whiteboard/new
These pages work completely independently with no backend calls
Changes are not saved and not shared with others
Perfect for quick, private coding or drawing
Collaborative Mode:
Create a session first (requires login)
You can make sessions public (visible to all users) or private (only accessible with the ID)
Other users can join and collaborate in real-time
Changes are synchronized across all participants
Public vs. Private Sessions:
Public sessions are listed in the LiveSessions page for anyone to see and join
Private sessions require knowing the session ID and manually entering it
This implementation aligns perfectly with your requirements:
Standalone mode for quick private use without any session creation
Collaborative mode when you need to work with others
Public vs. private session options
The code is now much simpler too, focusing on true standalone functionality without trying to reconcile with the backend when in standalone mode.
